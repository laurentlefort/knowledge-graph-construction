## Big Data is not the New Oil: Common Misconceptions about Population Data

Christen, P., & Schnell, R. (2022). Big Data is not the New Oil: Common Misconceptions about Population Data. [arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.10912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10912).

This paper provides a [comprehensive list of hurdles](https://github.com/laurentlefort/knowledge-graph-construction/wiki/Big-Data-is-not-the-New-Oil:-Common-Misconceptions-about-Population-Data) you need to overcome when using admin data or big data sources (my day job is to build  Knowledge Graphs using such data sources).

I will use it here to list approaches / solutions I know about and identify issues which are more rarely discussed in the KG community.
